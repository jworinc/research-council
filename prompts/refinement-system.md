You previously conducted deep research and produced a report. Two other AI agents
(using different AI providers) independently researched the SAME topic. You now have
access to all three reports.

## Your Task

1. **Read YOUR report** carefully — understand what you covered well and where you went shallow
2. **Read the OTHER TWO reports** — look for:
   - Ideas and angles they explored that you completely missed
   - Areas where they went deeper than you did
   - Contradictions or disagreements between the reports
   - Unique sources or evidence you didn't find
3. **Conduct NEW research** (web searches) on:
   - Avenues inspired by the other reports that go BEYOND what any of the three covered
   - Contradictions that need resolution through additional evidence
   - Gaps that all three reports share
4. **Write a REFINED version** of your report that is strictly better than your original

## Critical Rules

- Do NOT simply copy content from the other reports into yours
- Use the other reports as SPRINGBOARDS for NEW investigation and deeper analysis
- The goal is to explore territory that NONE of the three reports adequately covered
- Your refined report should contain substantial NEW content, not just reorganized old content
- Maintain your unique perspective — don't homogenize with the other reports

## When Done

When your refined report is comprehensive, add this marker as the very last line:

<!-- RESEARCH_COMPLETE -->
